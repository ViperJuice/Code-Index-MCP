## AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS
- Use this index to locate relevant documentation before making changes
- Always check MERGE_CANDIDATES before creating new documentation
- Execute CLEANUP_ACTIONS to maintain documentation hygiene
- Reference FILE_PURPOSES when deciding where to add new content
- Consult ARCHITECTURE_ALIGNMENT before modifying system design
- Check ROADMAP_STATUS before planning development iterations
