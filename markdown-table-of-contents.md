# Status: Documentation synchronization complete, architecture-roadmap aligned

## AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS
- Use this index to locate relevant documentation before making changes
- Always check MERGE_CANDIDATES before creating new documentation  
- Execute CLEANUP_ACTIONS to maintain documentation hygiene
- Reference FILE_PURPOSES when deciding where to add new content
- **NEW**: Consult ARCHITECTURE_ALIGNMENT before modifying system design
- **NEW**: Check ROADMAP_STATUS before planning development iterations
- CLAUDE.md stubs are intentional navigation aids - do not remove
- AGENTS.md files contain the primary implementation guidance
- All documentation is current as of June 2025 - excellent maintenance status

### CONSOLIDATION_OPPORTUNITIES
```
ROOT_CLUTTER_CLEANUP: 27 status/report files → MOVE_TO: docs/status/
  AFFECTED: *_SUMMARY.md, *_REPORT.md, DEBUG_AND_FIX_PLAN.md, etc.
  REASON: Root directory should only contain essential project files
  IMPACT: Improved navigation and professional appearance

OVERLAPPING_STATUS_REPORTS: Multiple test summaries → CONSOLIDATE_TO: docs/status/testing-summary.md
  DUPLICATES: EDGE_CASE_TESTS_SUMMARY.md, TEST_SUITE_IMPLEMENTATION_REPORT.md, COMPREHENSIVE_TEST_SUITE_SUMMARY.md
  REASON: Multiple test summaries create confusion
  ACTION: Merge into comprehensive testing status document

IMPLEMENTATION_REPORTS: Plugin summaries → CONSOLIDATE_TO: docs/status/plugin-implementation.md  
  AFFECTED: MARKDOWN_PLUGIN_SUMMARY.md, PLAINTEXT_PLUGIN_SUMMARY.md, SWIFT_PLUGIN_SUMMARY.md, etc.
  REASON: Plugin implementation status should be centralized
  ACTION: Create master plugin status tracking document
```

```
# When creating new documentation:
"Before creating new docs, check SEMANTIC_CLUSTERS and FILE_INVENTORY to avoid duplication. Verify alignment with current ROADMAP_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS and ARCHITECTURE_MATURITY. Check CONSOLIDATION_OPPORTUNITIES for existing content that should be merged."

# When modifying existing documentation:
"Check REFERENCE_MAP to understand dependencies before major changes. Update AGENTS.md files to reflect implementation status. Ensure changes align with C4_MODEL_STATUS and current architecture."

# For documentation cleanup:
"Execute IMMEDIATE_CLEANUP actions first, then CONSOLIDATION_EXECUTION, then ARCHITECTURE_ALIGNMENT_TASKS. Move status reports to docs/status/ to reduce root directory clutter."
```

### FOR_ARCHITECTURE_WORK
```
# When modifying architecture:
"Check ARCHITECTURE_ROADMAP_ALIGNMENT section before making changes. Update both C4 model files AND roadmap completion percentages. Propagate changes across corresponding C4 levels (Context→Container→Component→Code)."

# When updating implementation:
"Update corresponding architecture documentation: workspace.dsl for major changes, specific PlantUML files for implementation details. Maintain alignment between ROADMAP_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS and actual code."

# For architectural decisions:
"Consult DEVELOPMENT_ITERATION_GUIDANCE for current priorities. Ensure architectural decisions are documented and aligned with roadmap phases. Update complexity annotations when making significant changes."
```

### FOR_DEVELOPMENT_PLANNING
```
# When planning development iterations:
"Consult DEVELOPMENT_ITERATION_GUIDANCE for prioritized next steps. Check ARCHITECTURAL_DECISIONS_NEEDED before starting implementation. Ensure roadmap alignment and update completion percentages."

# For missing features:
"Check CONTENT_GAPS for missing critical components. Prioritize based on IMMEDIATE_PRIORITIES and architectural impact. Update both implementation and documentation."

# For validation work:
"Focus on RECENTLY_IMPLEMENTED components that require validation. Complete testing before updating production readiness claims. Document validation results in docs/status/."
```

### FOR_PROJECT_MAINTENANCE
```
# For project structure compliance:
"Maintain standard project structure: essential files in root, comprehensive docs in docs/, architecture in architecture/, status reports in docs/status/. Remove non-standard files from root directory."

# For legal compliance:
"Ensure LICENSE file exists and is referenced in README.md. Create missing community files (CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, GitHub templates). Verify all documentation references are valid."

# For ongoing maintenance:
"Monitor ARCHITECTURE_IMPLEMENTATION_ALIGNMENT for drift. Keep ROADMAP_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS accurate. Consolidate overlapping documentation regularly."
```

## QUALITY_METRICS

### CURRENT_STATUS_SUMMARY
```
TOTAL_FILES: 82 markdown files (~1.2MB documentation)
DOCUMENTATION_HEALTH: GOOD (needs cleanup)
AI_AGENT_CONTEXT: EXCELLENT (24 files, optimally organized)  
HUMAN_DOCUMENTATION: GOOD (31 core files, 27 status reports need cleanup)
ARCHITECTURE_MATURITY: ADVANCED (95% complete, strong C4 implementation)
IMPLEMENTATION_ALIGNMENT: STRONG (85% alignment, recent additions need validation)
PROJECT_STRUCTURE_COMPLIANCE: GOOD (85%, missing critical files)
DEVELOPMENT_READINESS: GOOD (85%, clear guidelines, missing some tooling)
```

### RECOMMENDATIONS_SUMMARY
```
IMMEDIATE: Create LICENSE file, move status reports to docs/status/, update roadmap accuracy
SHORT_TERM: Complete document processing validation, publish performance benchmarks
MEDIUM_TERM: Implement production monitoring, create user documentation
ONGOING: Maintain architecture-implementation alignment, consolidate overlapping documentation
```

This comprehensive analysis provides detailed guidance for both immediate cleanup activities and strategic development planning, with clear prioritization and actionable insights for maintaining the project's strong architectural foundation while addressing critical gaps.
