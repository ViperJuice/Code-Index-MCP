# Code-Index-MCP Development Roadmap

> **Note for AI Agents**: This roadmap is designed for autonomous AI agents to understand project status and determine next implementation steps. Focus on completing high-priority items that unblock further progress. Work in parallel when possible.

## Project Overview
Code-Index-MCP is a local-first code indexing system providing fast symbol search and code navigation across multiple programming languages. The architecture includes language-specific plugins, persistence layer, and operational components.

## Current Implementation Status (~65% Complete)

### ✅ Completed Components
- Core architecture established (dual pattern: target + actual)
- FastAPI gateway with endpoints: `/symbol`, `/search`, `/status`, `/plugins`, `/reindex`
- Python plugin fully functional with Tree-sitter + Jedi
- JavaScript/TypeScript plugin fully functional with Tree-sitter
- C plugin fully functional with Tree-sitter
- Dispatcher routing with caching and auto-initialization
- File watcher integrated with automatic re-indexing
- SQLite persistence layer with FTS5 search
- Error handling and logging framework
- Comprehensive testing framework with pytest
- CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
- Docker support and containerization
- Build system (Makefile, pyproject.toml)
- Caching layer in dispatcher (content-based)
- Basic documentation structure

### ⚠️ Partially Complete
- 3 language plugins have implementation guides but no code (C++, HTML/CSS, Dart)
- Documentation exists but needs API reference
- Dynamic plugin loading (plugins hardcoded in gateway)

### ❌ Not Implemented
- C++, HTML/CSS, and Dart plugins (stubs only)
- Advanced metrics collection (Prometheus)
- Security layer (JWT authentication)
- Task queue system (Celery + Redis)
- Semantic search features
- Cloud sync capabilities
- Additional language support beyond planned 6

## Architecture Components

### Phase 1: Foundation (✅ COMPLETE)
- File watcher integration
- Core API endpoints
- Basic persistence
- Error handling framework

### Phase 2: Core Components (✅ 60% COMPLETE)
- **Language Plugins** (3 of 6 complete: Python, JavaScript, C; 3 remaining: C++, HTML/CSS, Dart)
- **Testing Framework** (✅ COMPLETE - pytest infrastructure with 7 test files)
- **CI/CD Pipeline** (✅ COMPLETE - GitHub Actions with multi-OS support)
- **Build System** (✅ COMPLETE - Makefile, Docker, pyproject.toml)
- **Plugin System Enhancements** (❌ dynamic loading still needed)

### Phase 3: Persistence & Storage
- Query optimization
- Index management
- Performance optimizations for scale
- Backup/restore functionality

### Phase 4: Operational Components
- Cache layer (Redis/in-memory)
- Metrics collection (Prometheus/OpenTelemetry)
- Security implementation (JWT, validation)
- Task queue system (Celery + Redis)

### Phase 5: Advanced Features
- Semantic search integration with embeddings
- Hybrid search (lexical + semantic)
- Cloud sync implementation
- Embedding service

### Phase 6: Production Readiness
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening
- API documentation
- Deployment guides

### Phase 7: Ecosystem Extensions
- Additional languages (Rust, Go, Ruby, Swift)
- IDE integrations
- Web UI dashboard

## Success Metrics

### Performance Requirements
- Symbol lookup: < 100ms (p95)
- Semantic search: < 500ms (p95)
- Indexing speed: 10K files/minute
- Memory usage: < 2GB for 100K files

### Quality Requirements
- All language plugins functional
- 90%+ test coverage
- Zero critical security issues
- Complete API documentation

## Risk Factors

1. **Stub Plugins**: 3 of 6 language plugins unimplemented (C++, HTML/CSS, Dart - guides exist)
2. **Performance Unknown**: No benchmarks against requirements
3. **Security Layer Missing**: No JWT authentication implemented
4. **Documentation Gaps**: Missing API reference docs
5. **Dynamic Plugin Loading**: Plugins are hardcoded in gateway

## Next Steps - Priority Implementation Tasks

### Recently Completed (✅)
1. **Testing Framework** - COMPLETE with pytest, fixtures, and 7 test files
2. **JavaScript Plugin** - COMPLETE with full Tree-sitter implementation
3. **C Plugin** - COMPLETE with full Tree-sitter implementation
4. **CI/CD Pipeline** - COMPLETE with GitHub Actions
5. **Build System** - COMPLETE with Makefile, Docker, pyproject.toml

### Critical Path Items (Blocking Other Work)

1. **Performance Benchmarks** - Required to validate against requirements
   - Create benchmark suite using pytest-benchmark
   - Test symbol lookup < 100ms (p95)
   - Test indexing speed for 10K files/minute
   - Measure memory usage for large codebases

2. **Dynamic Plugin Loading** - Currently hardcoded in gateway
   - Implement plugin discovery mechanism
   - Update gateway.py to load plugins dynamically
   - Support plugin configuration files

### Parallel Execution Opportunities

The following can be implemented simultaneously without conflicts:

**Group A - Remaining Language Plugins** (Independent implementations):
- **C++ Plugin**: `mcp_server/plugins/cpp_plugin/plugin.py` (guide exists)
- **HTML/CSS Plugin**: `mcp_server/plugins/html_css_plugin/plugin.py` (guide exists)
- **Dart Plugin**: `mcp_server/plugins/dart_plugin/plugin.py` (guide exists)

**Group B - Documentation & Optimization** (Non-conflicting):
- **API Reference Documentation**: Generate from existing endpoints
- **Query Optimization**: Enhance SQLite queries in `sqlite_store.py`
- **Performance Profiling**: Profile existing implementations

**Group C - Advanced Features** (After benchmarks complete):
- **Semantic Search**: Integrate embeddings with Voyage AI
- **Security Layer**: Add JWT authentication
- **Metrics Collection**: Implement Prometheus metrics

### Implementation Priority Order

1. **Immediate**: Performance Benchmarks + Dynamic Plugin Loading
2. **High Priority**: Group A remaining plugins (C++, HTML/CSS, Dart)
3. **Medium Priority**: Group B documentation and optimization
4. **Lower Priority**: Group C advanced features

### Success Validation

For each implementation:
1. Code follows existing patterns (see Python plugin)
2. Includes comprehensive error handling
3. Has >80% test coverage
4. Updates gateway.py startup handler if needed
5. Documentation updated

### Dependencies to Note

- All plugins depend on Tree-sitter grammars (install first)
- Operational components may require new dependencies (Redis, Prometheus)
- Performance testing requires representative test data

*Last Updated: 2025-01-30*
*Status Key: ✅ Complete | ⚠️ Partial | ❌ Not Started*

## Recent Progress Summary

Since the last update, significant progress has been made:
- **Testing Framework**: Fully implemented with pytest, fixtures, and 7 comprehensive test files
- **JavaScript Plugin**: Complete implementation with Tree-sitter parsing for JS/TS/JSX/TSX
- **C Plugin**: Complete implementation with Tree-sitter parsing for C/H files
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: GitHub Actions with multi-OS testing, linting, and security scanning
- **Build System**: Complete with Makefile, Docker support, and proper dependency management

The project has advanced from ~25% to ~65% completion, with a solid foundation for the remaining work.
