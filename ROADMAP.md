- ‚úÖ Plugin system foundation in place
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Multiple merge conflicts need resolution
- ‚ùå Several critical components need implementation
- ‚ùå Minimal test coverage
- ‚ùå Operational components not implemented

## Architecture Alignment
This roadmap follows the target architecture:
- **Level 1**: System context with performance SLAs
- **Level 2**: 14 containers including operational components
- **Level 3**: Detailed component architecture
- **Supporting Docs**: Performance, Security, Data Model
