## Migration Tracking

### Phase 1: Pre-Migration Testing
- [x] MCP server functionality verified
- [ ] Create backup
- [ ] Document file movements

### Stream A: Documentation Consolidation
Status: COMPLETED
- All documentation already well organized in docs/

#### Files to Move:
```
From Root → To docs/reports/archives/
```

### Stream B: Script Organization  
Status: COMPLETED ✓

#### Files to Move:
```
mcp_cli.py → scripts/cli/
mcp_server_cli.py → scripts/cli/
scaffold_code.py → scripts/development/
scaffold_mcp.sh → scripts/development/
simple_test.py → scripts/testing/
```

### Stream C: Configuration Management
Status: COMPLETED ✓
- Updated Makefile references
- Updated docker-compose.yml prometheus path

#### Files to Move:
```
docker-compose.dev.yml → docker/compose/development/
docker-compose.development.yml → docker/compose/development/
docker-compose.production.yml → docker/compose/production/
docker-compose.monitoring.yml → docker/compose/production/
prometheus.yml → monitoring/config/
```

### Stream D: Test/Data Organization
Status: COMPLETED ✓
- Updated .gitignore for new paths
- Updated test file references

#### Directories to Move:
```
test_complete_behavior/ → tests/fixtures/complete_behavior/

```

### Stream E: Testing & Validation
Status: PENDING

## Rollback Commands

```bash
# Example rollback for a moved file
git mv <new_location> <original_location>
```
