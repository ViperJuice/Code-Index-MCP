# MCP Verification Test Results

## Test Execution Summary

All tests have been successfully executed to verify the MCP enhancements.

### Test Results

| Test | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| 1. Tool Descriptions | ✅ PASS | [MCP-FIRST] prefix visible in tool descriptions |
| 2. Navigation Hints | ✅ PASS | _usage_hint fields present in all responses |
| 3. Symbol Lookup | ✅ PASS | Fast and accurate symbol resolution |
| 4. Pattern Search | ✅ PASS | Regex and semantic search working |
| 5. Anti-patterns | ✅ PASS | MCP handles grep-like requests correctly |
| 6. Offset Usage | ✅ PASS | Line offset calculation verified (line-1) |
| 7. Performance | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Initial load ~42s, subsequent faster |

### Key Findings

1. **Navigation Efficiency**: The `_usage_hint` field successfully guides users to use the offset parameter, avoiding reading from line 1.

2. **MCP-First Pattern**: The [MCP-FIRST] prefix in tool descriptions should help Claude Code prioritize MCP tools over native search commands.

3. **Response Format**: All MCP responses now include helpful navigation instructions:
   ```json
   {
     "symbol": "ClassName",
     "line": 23,
     "defined_in": "file.py",
     "_usage_hint": "To view definition: Read(file_path='file.py', offset=22, limit=20)"
   }
   ```

4. **Performance Note**: Initial plugin loading takes time but subsequent queries should be much faster due to caching.

### Example Usage

When Claude Code receives a symbol lookup result:
```json
{
  "symbol": "IndexDiscovery",
  "line": 23,
  "defined_in": "demo_index_management.py",
  "_usage_hint": "To view definition: Read(file_path='demo_index_management.py', offset=22, limit=20)"
}
```

Claude Code should use: `Read(file_path='demo_index_management.py', offset=22, limit=20)`
Instead of: `Read(file_path='demo_index_management.py')` (which starts from line 1)

### Verification Complete

The MCP enhancements have been successfully implemented and tested. The system now provides clear guidance for efficient code navigation using line offsets.
