Technical Specification: Distributed Code Index Architecture

1. System Architecture Overview

The distributed code index system employs a microservices architecture with the following core components:

- Index Coordinator Service: Manages distributed indexing tasks and maintains global state
- Worker Nodes: Perform actual file parsing and symbol extraction
- Storage Layer: Distributed database for index persistence
- Query Router: Handles search requests and aggregates results
- Cache Layer: Redis-based caching for frequently accessed data

2. Communication Protocol

All inter-service communication uses gRPC with Protocol Buffers for efficient binary serialization. The protocol definition includes:

service CodeIndexService {
  rpc IndexRepository (IndexRequest) returns (IndexResponse);
  rpc SearchCode (SearchRequest) returns (stream SearchResult);
  rpc GetSymbol (SymbolRequest) returns (SymbolResponse);
}

Message format specifications ensure backward compatibility through versioning fields.

3. Data Storage Schema

Primary storage utilizes a distributed PostgreSQL cluster with the following schema:

- files: Stores file metadata (id, path, hash, last_modified, language)
- symbols: Contains extracted symbols (id, file_id, name, type, line, column)
- references: Maps symbol usage (symbol_id, file_id, line, column)
- indexes: Maintains full-text search indexes using pg_trgm extension

Sharding strategy: Content-based sharding using consistent hashing on file paths.

4. Indexing Algorithm

The indexing process follows these steps:

4.1 File Discovery
- Traverse directory structure using parallel workers
- Apply gitignore rules and custom filters
- Calculate file hashes for change detection

4.2 Parsing Pipeline
- Language detection using file extensions and content analysis
- Dispatch to language-specific parsers (Tree-sitter based)
- Extract symbols, definitions, and references
- Generate semantic tokens for advanced features

4.3 Index Construction
- Build inverted indexes for text search
- Create symbol tables with scope information
- Generate cross-reference mappings
- Calculate file-level metrics (complexity, dependencies)

5. Query Processing

Search queries undergo the following transformation:

5.1 Query Analysis
- Tokenization and normalization
- Language detection for syntax-aware search
- Query plan optimization based on index statistics

5.2 Execution Strategy
- Parallel query execution across shards
- Result ranking using TF-IDF and semantic similarity
- Pagination with cursor-based navigation
- Response streaming for large result sets

6. Performance Optimizations

Key optimizations implemented:

- Incremental indexing: Only process changed files
- Bloom filters: Quick negative lookups for symbol existence
- Compression: Zstd compression for stored indexes
- Connection pooling: Reuse database connections
- Batch processing: Group similar operations

7. Scalability Considerations

The system scales horizontally with these mechanisms:

- Stateless worker nodes: Easy addition/removal
- Partition tolerance: Continues operating with node failures
- Load balancing: Consistent hashing for work distribution
- Auto-scaling: Based on queue depth and CPU metrics

8. Monitoring and Observability

Comprehensive monitoring includes:

- Metrics: Prometheus metrics for all services
- Tracing: OpenTelemetry distributed tracing
- Logging: Structured JSON logs with correlation IDs
- Health checks: Kubernetes-compatible liveness/readiness probes

9. Security Model

Security measures implemented:

- Authentication: JWT tokens with RSA signatures
- Authorization: RBAC with fine-grained permissions
- Encryption: TLS 1.3 for all network communication
- Audit logging: Complete audit trail of all operations

10. Deployment Configuration

Standard deployment uses Kubernetes with:

- Horizontal Pod Autoscaling for dynamic scaling
- PersistentVolumeClaims for stateful storage
- ConfigMaps for configuration management
- Secrets for sensitive data storage
- Ingress controllers for external access

This architecture ensures high performance, reliability, and scalability for code indexing operations across large, distributed codebases.
