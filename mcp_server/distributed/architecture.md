# Distributed Processing Architecture

## Components
1. Master Node - Job scheduling and coordination
2. Worker Nodes - Parallel processing units  
3. Message Queue - Redis for job distribution
4. Result Store - Aggregated results storage

## Workflow
1. Master receives indexing request
2. Master splits work into chunks
3. Workers pull jobs from queue
4. Workers process and store results
5. Master aggregates final index

## Container Deployment
- Master runs in main container
- Workers can be scaled via docker-compose
- Redis handles job queue
- Shared volumes for result storage
