- ✅ Plugin discovery and lifecycle management

## CODE_STYLE_PREFERENCES

### Python Conventions (Discovered from codebase)
- **Functions**: snake_case (e.g., `create_mcp_jsonrpc_handler`, `validate_mcp_request`)
- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `Dispatcher`, `PluginCapability`, `FileTypeInfo`)
- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `MAX_FILE_SIZE`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`)
- **Private**: Leading underscore (e.g., `_internal_method()`)
- **Type Hints**: Always required for public APIs
- **Docstrings**: Google style for all public functions/classes

### Linting & Formatting (from Makefile)
- **Black**: Code formatting with 88-character line length
- **isort**: Import sorting with profile compatibility
- **flake8**: Style guide enforcement with E/W error codes
- **mypy**: Static type checking with strict mode
- **pylint**: Code analysis with custom configuration

## ARCHITECTURAL_PATTERNS

### Core Patterns Used in MCP Server
1. **MCP Protocol Implementation**: Standards-compliant JSON-RPC 2.0 with MCP extensions
2. **Plugin Architecture**: All language support via standardized IPlugin interface
3. **Dispatcher Pattern**: Intelligent request routing with caching and optimization
4. **Tree-sitter Integration**: Unified parsing across all supported languages
5. **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with context and recovery suggestions

### Development Patterns
- **Result Pattern**: `Result[T, Error]` for all operations that can fail
- **Interface Segregation**: Separate interfaces for different plugin capabilities
- **Dependency Injection**: Plugin discovery and lifecycle management
- **Event-Driven**: File watching with reactive indexing updates
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-tier caching with TTL and invalidation

## DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT

### Requirements (from project analysis)
- **Python**: 3.8+ (3.10+ recommended for optimal performance)
- **Virtual Environment**: Required (`python -m venv venv`)
- **Dependencies**: `pip install -r requirements.txt && pip install -e .`
- **Tree-sitter**: Automatically managed by plugin system
- **Docker**: Optional but recommended for full stack testing

### IDE Setup
- **VS Code**: Project settings configured in `.vscode/` directory
