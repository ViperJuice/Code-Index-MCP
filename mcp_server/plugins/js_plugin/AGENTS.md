# JavaScript Plugin Agent Configuration

## Implementation Status
‚ùå **STUB IMPLEMENTATION** - This plugin is NOT implemented

## Overview
This is a stub plugin that exists only as a placeholder. All methods contain only `...` (ellipsis) and do not provide any functionality.

## Current State

```python
class Plugin(IPlugin):
    lang = "js"
    
    def supports(self, path):
        ...  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
    
    def indexFile(self, path, content):
        ...  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
    
    def getDefinition(self, symbol):
        ...  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
    
    def findReferences(self, symbol):
        ...  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
    
    def search(self, query, opts):
        ...  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
```

## What Would Need Implementation

If this plugin were to be implemented, it would need:
- Tree-sitter JavaScript grammar integration
- ES6+ syntax support
- Module resolution (CommonJS, ES modules)
- Scope and closure analysis
- Prototype chain tracking
- Async/await handling
- JSX support (for React)
- TypeScript support consideration

## Current Limitations
- **No functionality**: All methods are stubs
- **Cannot parse JavaScript files**: No Tree-sitter integration
- **Cannot index symbols**: No parsing logic
- **Cannot find definitions or references**: No symbol tracking
- **Cannot search**: No indexing capability

## Next Steps for Implementation
1. Integrate Tree-sitter JavaScript grammar
2. Implement basic parsing in `indexFile()`
3. Add symbol extraction for:
   - Functions (regular, arrow, async)
   - Classes and constructors
   - Variables (var, let, const)
   - Object properties and methods
4. Handle JavaScript-specific features:
   - Hoisting
   - Closures and scope
   - Prototype inheritance
   - Module imports/exports
   - Destructuring assignments
5. Add framework-specific understanding (React, Vue, etc.)
6. Consider TypeScript integration

## Testing
No tests exist for this stub implementation.
