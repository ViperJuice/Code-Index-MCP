# HTML/CSS Plugin Agent Configuration

## Implementation Status
‚ùå **STUB IMPLEMENTATION** - This plugin is NOT implemented

## Overview
This is a stub plugin that exists only as a placeholder. All methods contain only `...` (ellipsis) and do not provide any functionality.

## Current State

```python
class Plugin(IPlugin):
    lang = "html_css"
    
    def supports(self, path):
        ...  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
    
    def indexFile(self, path, content):
        ...  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
    
    def getDefinition(self, symbol):
        ...  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
    
    def findReferences(self, symbol):
        ...  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
    
    def search(self, query, opts):
        ...  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
```

## What Would Need Implementation

If this plugin were to be implemented, it would need:
- Tree-sitter HTML and CSS grammar integration
- HTML DOM structure parsing
- CSS selector parsing and matching
- Style inheritance tracking
- Media query analysis
- CSS preprocessor support (SASS, LESS)
- HTML template language support

## Current Limitations
- **No functionality**: All methods are stubs
- **Cannot parse HTML/CSS files**: No Tree-sitter integration
- **Cannot index elements or styles**: No parsing logic
- **Cannot find definitions or references**: No symbol tracking
- **Cannot search**: No indexing capability

## Next Steps for Implementation
1. Integrate Tree-sitter HTML and CSS grammars
2. Implement basic parsing in `indexFile()`
3. Add extraction for:
   - HTML elements, IDs, and classes
   - CSS selectors and rules
   - Style properties and values
   - Data attributes
4. Handle HTML/CSS-specific features:
   - CSS cascade and specificity
   - Pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements
   - CSS custom properties (variables)
   - Flexbox and Grid layouts
   - Media queries and responsive design
5. Add preprocessor support (SASS/SCSS, LESS, Stylus)
6. Consider framework integration (Bootstrap, Tailwind)

## Testing
No tests exist for this stub implementation.
