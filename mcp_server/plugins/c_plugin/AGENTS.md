# C Plugin Agent Configuration

## Implementation Status
‚ùå **STUB IMPLEMENTATION** - This plugin is NOT implemented

## Overview
This is a stub plugin that exists only as a placeholder. All methods contain only `...` (ellipsis) and do not provide any functionality.

## Current State

```python
class Plugin(IPlugin):
    lang = "c"
    
    def supports(self, path):
        ...  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
    
    def indexFile(self, path, content):
        ...  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
    
    def getDefinition(self, symbol):
        ...  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
    
    def findReferences(self, symbol):
        ...  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
    
    def search(self, query, opts):
        ...  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
```

## What Would Need Implementation

If this plugin were to be implemented, it would need:
- Tree-sitter C grammar integration
- C preprocessor handling
- Header file resolution
- Symbol table management
- Macro expansion support
- Include path resolution

## Current Limitations
- **No functionality**: All methods are stubs
- **Cannot parse C files**: No Tree-sitter integration
- **Cannot index symbols**: No parsing logic
- **Cannot find definitions or references**: No symbol tracking
- **Cannot search**: No indexing capability

## Next Steps for Implementation
1. Integrate Tree-sitter C grammar
2. Implement basic parsing in `indexFile()`
3. Add symbol extraction logic
4. Handle C-specific features (structs, enums, typedefs)
5. Implement preprocessor directives handling
6. Add header file tracking

## Testing
No tests exist for this stub implementation.
