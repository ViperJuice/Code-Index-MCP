# C++ Plugin Agent Configuration

## Implementation Status
‚ùå **STUB IMPLEMENTATION** - This plugin is NOT implemented

## Overview
This is a stub plugin that exists only as a placeholder. All methods contain only `...` (ellipsis) and do not provide any functionality.

## Current State

```python
class Plugin(IPlugin):
    lang = "cpp"
    
    def supports(self, path):
        ...  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
    
    def indexFile(self, path, content):
        ...  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
    
    def getDefinition(self, symbol):
        ...  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
    
    def findReferences(self, symbol):
        ...  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
    
    def search(self, query, opts):
        ...  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
```

## What Would Need Implementation

If this plugin were to be implemented, it would need:
- Tree-sitter C++ grammar integration
- Template parsing and instantiation tracking
- Namespace resolution
- Class hierarchy analysis
- Overload resolution
- STL and standard library awareness
- Modern C++ feature support (C++11/14/17/20)

## Current Limitations
- **No functionality**: All methods are stubs
- **Cannot parse C++ files**: No Tree-sitter integration
- **Cannot index symbols**: No parsing logic
- **Cannot find definitions or references**: No symbol tracking
- **Cannot search**: No indexing capability

## Next Steps for Implementation
1. Integrate Tree-sitter C++ grammar
2. Implement basic parsing in `indexFile()`
3. Add symbol extraction for classes, functions, templates
4. Handle C++ specific features:
   - Templates and template specializations
   - Namespaces and using declarations
   - Multiple inheritance
   - Operator overloading
   - Lambda expressions
5. Implement name mangling/demangling
6. Add STL container and algorithm recognition

## Testing
No tests exist for this stub implementation.
