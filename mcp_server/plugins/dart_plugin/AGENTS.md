# Dart Plugin Agent Configuration

## Implementation Status
‚ùå **STUB IMPLEMENTATION** - This plugin is NOT implemented

## Overview
This is a stub plugin that exists only as a placeholder. All methods contain only `...` (ellipsis) and do not provide any functionality.

## Current State

```python
class Plugin(IPlugin):
    lang = "dart"
    
    def supports(self, path):
        ...  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
    
    def indexFile(self, path, content):
        ...  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
    
    def getDefinition(self, symbol):
        ...  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
    
    def findReferences(self, symbol):
        ...  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
    
    def search(self, query, opts):
        ...  # NOT IMPLEMENTED
```

## What Would Need Implementation

If this plugin were to be implemented, it would need:
- Tree-sitter Dart grammar integration
- Null safety understanding
- Mixin and extension method support
- Future/Stream async handling
- Widget tree analysis (for Flutter)
- Import/export resolution
- Strong typing support

## Current Limitations
- **No functionality**: All methods are stubs
- **Cannot parse Dart files**: No Tree-sitter integration
- **Cannot index symbols**: No parsing logic
- **Cannot find definitions or references**: No symbol tracking
- **Cannot search**: No indexing capability

## Next Steps for Implementation
1. Integrate Tree-sitter Dart grammar
2. Implement basic parsing in `indexFile()`
3. Add symbol extraction for:
   - Classes and constructors
   - Functions and methods
   - Variables and fields
   - Enums and mixins
4. Handle Dart-specific features:
   - Null safety operators (??, ?., !)
   - Extension methods
   - Mixins and with clauses
   - Async/await and Future/Stream
   - Generics and type parameters
5. Add Flutter-specific understanding (widgets, state management)
6. Implement package dependency resolution

## Testing
No tests exist for this stub implementation.
