# MCP vs Native Performance - Interim Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

After completing 11 out of 48 tests (22.9%), we have gathered sufficient data to identify clear performance patterns. **MCP tools are 1.9x faster on average** but use **3.5x more tokens**. Most critically, we discovered that **native tests are failing because test directories only contain index files, not source code**.

## Key Findings

### 1. Speed Performance ðŸš€
- **MCP Average**: 2,264ms per query
- **Native Average**: 4,312ms per query
- **Winner**: MCP is 1.9x faster

### 2. Token Efficiency ðŸ’°
- **MCP Average**: 9,686 tokens per query
- **Native Average**: 2,762 tokens per query
- **Winner**: Native uses 71% fewer tokens

### 3. Success Rates âœ…
- **MCP**: 43% success rate (3/7 tests)
- **Native**: 0% success rate (0/4 tests)
- **Issue**: Native tests fail due to missing source files in test directories

## Critical Discovery

The native tests are systematically failing because the test directories (`/workspaces/Code-Index-MCP/test_indexes/`) only contain index database files, not the actual source code. This makes native tool searches impossible.

Example error:
```
"No source code files found in the directory - only index database files present"
```

## Performance by Repository

### Go (Gin) - 7/12 tests complete
- MCP: 50% success rate, avg 1,838ms
- Native: 0% success rate (no source files)

### Python (Django) - 2/12 tests complete
- MCP: 100% success rate, found BaseHandler successfully
- Native: Failed due to missing source files

### JavaScript (React) - 1/12 tests complete
- MCP: Failed to find React-specific results
- Native: Not tested yet

### Rust (Tokio) - 1/12 tests complete
- MCP: Failed to find tokio-specific results
- Native: Not tested yet

## Key Insights

1. **MCP Cross-Repository Issue**: MCP searches are returning results from other repositories instead of the target repository, suggesting the index might not be properly scoped.

2. **Native Test Setup Issue**: The test configuration assumes source code is present, but only index files exist in the test directories.

3. **Symbol Searches**: MCP excels at symbol searches when properly indexed (e.g., Django BaseHandler found successfully).

4. **Content Searches**: Both approaches struggle with content searches (TODO, FIXME) in the test repositories.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Fix Test Setup**: Either:
   - Point native tests to actual source code directories
   - Copy source files to test directories
   - Adjust test expectations

2. **Fix MCP Repository Scoping**: Ensure MCP searches are properly filtered to target repositories

### Performance Guidance (Preliminary)
- **Use MCP for**: Symbol lookups, cross-file navigation, semantic searches
- **Use Native for**: Simple pattern matching (if source access is available)
- **Token Budget**: Consider 3.5x token cost when choosing MCP

## Next Steps

1. Continue testing remaining 37 configurations
2. Address the native test directory issue
3. Investigate MCP cross-repository result filtering
4. Complete full analysis once all tests are done
