# Updated MCP vs Native Performance Analysis Report

**Date**: January 6, 2025  
**Test Coverage**: 42 out of 80 tests completed (52.5%)  
**Repositories Tested**: Go (gin), Python (Django), JavaScript (React), Rust (tokio)

## Executive Summary

After completing 42 performance tests comparing MCP (Model Context Protocol) indexed search against native command-line tools, the results show significant performance variations by repository type and language.

### Key Findings

1. **Overall Performance**: Native tools are 2.5x faster on average than MCP
2. **Token Efficiency**: Native tools use 71% fewer tokens than MCP
3. **Success Rates**: Native (87%) vs MCP (58%)
4. **Repository-Specific Performance Varies Dramatically**

## Detailed Performance Metrics

### By Repository

#### Go (gin) - 15 tests
- **MCP Performance**: 1,970ms average, 10,100 tokens
- **Native Performance**: 2,497ms average, 4,875 tokens  
- **Winner**: MCP is 1.3x faster
- **Note**: MCP performs better for Go codebases

#### Python (Django) - 11 tests
- **MCP Performance**: 4,400ms average, 8,767 tokens
- **Native Performance**: 425ms average, 1,525 tokens
- **Winner**: Native is 10.4x faster
- **Note**: Native tools excel with Python's readable syntax

#### JavaScript (React) - 9 tests  
- **MCP Performance**: 6,000ms average, 7,850 tokens
- **Native Performance**: 596ms average, 1,843 tokens
- **Winner**: Native is 10.1x faster
- **Note**: Large React codebase favors native grep/find

#### Rust (tokio) - 7 tests
- **MCP Performance**: 875ms average, 10,750 tokens
- **Native Performance**: 960ms average, 1,660 tokens  
- **Winner**: MCP is 1.1x faster (but 0% success rate)
- **Note**: MCP failed all Rust tests due to tool availability

## Success Rate Analysis

### MCP Success Rates by Repository
- Go: 60% (3/5 tests)
- Python: 100% (3/3 tests)
- JavaScript: 50% (1/2 tests)
- Rust: 0% (0/2 tests)

### Native Success Rates by Repository  
- Go: 70% (7/10 tests)
- Python: 88% (7/8 tests)
- JavaScript: 100% (7/7 tests)
- Rust: 100% (5/5 tests)

## Performance by Query Category

Based on completed tests:

### Symbol Searches
- Native excels at finding specific symbols (functions, classes)
- Average native time: ~400ms
- Average MCP time: ~2,000ms

### Navigation Queries
- Both perform well for file dependency queries
- Native: ~600ms average
- MCP: ~1,500ms average (when successful)

### Semantic/Understanding Queries
- Native requires more complex grep patterns
- MCP theoretically better but often fails
- Native: ~1,200ms average
- MCP: ~4,000ms average

## Tool Usage Patterns

### Native Tools
- Most common: Grep (used in 90% of tests)
- Secondary: Bash, Find, Glob
- Average tools per query: 2.1

### MCP Tools  
- Primary: mcp__code-index-mcp__search_code
- Secondary: mcp__code-index-mcp__symbol_lookup
- Average tools per query: 2 (when successful)

## Recommendations

### When to Use Native Tools
1. **Python Projects**: 10x performance advantage
2. **JavaScript/Web Projects**: 10x performance advantage  
3. **Quick symbol lookups**: Faster and more reliable
4. **Token-constrained environments**: 71% fewer tokens

### When to Use MCP
1. **Go Projects**: 1.3x performance advantage
2. **Complex semantic queries**: Better understanding (when working)
3. **Cross-file relationship analysis**: More sophisticated

### Critical Issues with MCP
1. **Availability**: 42% failure rate due to tool availability
2. **Consistency**: Performance varies wildly by language
3. **Token Usage**: 3.5x more tokens on average

## Conclusion

While MCP shows promise for certain use cases (Go projects, semantic understanding), native tools currently provide:
- More consistent performance
- Higher reliability (87% vs 58% success)
- Significantly lower token usage
- Better performance for 2 out of 4 tested languages

For production use, a hybrid approach is recommended:
- Use native tools as the primary search method
- Fall back to MCP for complex semantic queries
- Consider language-specific strategies

## Next Steps

1. Complete remaining 38 tests for full dataset
2. Investigate MCP tool availability issues  
3. Create language-specific optimization strategies
4. Develop hybrid search implementation
