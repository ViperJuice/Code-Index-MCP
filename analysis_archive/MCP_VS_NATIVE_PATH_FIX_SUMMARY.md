# MCP vs Native Testing - Path Fix Summary

## Issue Resolved âœ…

We discovered and fixed a critical issue preventing native tests from working properly.

### The Problem
- Native tests were configured to search in `/test_indexes/` directories
- These directories only contained SQLite index database files (.db)
- No actual source code was present, causing all native grep/find operations to fail

### The Solution
1. **Located Actual Source Code**: Found repositories in `/test_repos/` directory structure
2. **Updated Path Mappings**:
   - `go_gin`: `/test_repos/modern/go/gin/` (93 Go files)
   - `python_django`: `/test_repos/web/python/django/` (2,839 Python files)
   - `javascript_react`: `/test_repos/web/javascript/react/` (3,574 JS files)
   - `rust_tokio`: `/test_repos/systems/rust/tokio/` (711 Rust files)

3. **Created Fixed Test Generator**: `run_comprehensive_performance_test_fixed.py`
4. **Generated New Test Configurations**: 80 tests total with corrected paths

## Verification

Successfully tested native search with corrected paths:
- **Query**: "Find the definition of class BaseHandler"
- **Repository**: Django
- **Result**: Found in 150ms using grep + read (vs previous failure)

## Impact on Results

### Before Fix
- Native tests: 0% success rate (all failed due to missing files)
- MCP appeared artificially superior

### After Fix
- Native tests now work correctly with actual source code
- Fair comparison possible between indexed (MCP) and grep-based (native) search

## Scripts Created
1. `run_comprehensive_performance_test_fixed.py` - Test generator with correct paths
2. `rerun_failed_native_tests.py` - Helper to identify and re-run failed tests

## Next Steps
1. Complete execution of remaining tests with corrected configurations
2. Re-run the one failed native test identified
3. Generate comprehensive analysis with valid native performance data
4. Create final report with fair MCP vs Native comparison

This fix ensures we get accurate, meaningful performance comparisons between MCP's indexed search and native tool operations on actual source code.
