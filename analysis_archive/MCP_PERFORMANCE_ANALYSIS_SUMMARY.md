# MCP vs Direct Retrieval Performance Analysis - Summary

## Analysis Overview

We analyzed **453 tool uses** from **5 Claude Code transcripts** and performed controlled performance tests comparing MCP tools against traditional grep/find approaches.

## Key Findings

### 1. MCP is Dramatically Underutilized
- **Current MCP usage: 2.2%** of all tool calls
- **Token reduction with MCP: 95%** average
- **Speed improvement: 8-70x** faster depending on query type

### 2. Performance Comparison by Query Type

| Query Type | MCP Time | Direct Time | Speed Gain | Token Reduction |
|------------|----------|-------------|------------|-----------------|
| Symbol Search | 50ms | 3,520ms | **70.4x** | **99%** |
| Content Search | 100ms | 863ms | **8.6x** | **100%** |
| Navigation | N/A | 369ms | - | - |

### 3. Real Usage Patterns from Transcripts
- **Read operations**: 22.7% of all tool uses
  - 54.4% use `limit` parameter (efficient)
  - 45.6% read entire files (inefficient)
- **Direct search**: 6.6% (Grep/Glob/LS)
- **Edit operations**: 23.6%
  - 67 partial edits
  - 40 full file rewrites

## Recommendations

### Use MCP For:
✅ Symbol lookups (class/function definitions)
✅ Cross-file content searches
✅ Large codebases
✅ Repeated searches

### Use Direct Tools For:
⚠️ Unindexed files
⚠️ Full file context needed
⚠️ Simple navigation
⚠️ One-off searches

## Impact Potential

If MCP usage increased from 2.2% to 30%:
- **26% reduction** in overall token usage
- **Significantly faster** response times
- **More accurate** search results
