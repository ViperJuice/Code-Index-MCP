# Documentation Update Report
Generated: 2025-01-06

## Update Summary

### 1. AGENTS.md Status Update ✅
- **Updated**: Project status from "100% Complete" to "95% Complete"
- **Added**: Critical blocker section for MCP sub-agent issues (83% failure rate)
- **Added**: Phase 1 completion status (50% - 4/8 agents implemented)
- **Listed**: Completed agents 1-4 with their implementations
- **Listed**: Remaining agents 5-8 with descriptions

### 2. ROADMAP.md Next Steps Enhancement ✅
- **Added**: Interface-first development strategy section
- **Added**: Phase 1 status with detailed agent tracking
- **Added**: Complexity annotations for all tasks (1-5 scale)
- **Added**: Architecture file mappings table
- **Added**: Parallel execution guidelines
- **Added**: Progress tracking instructions

### 3. Architecture Implementation Status ✅
- **Created**: `architecture/implementation-status.md`
- **Documented**: All component implementation percentages
- **Listed**: 5 major divergences from planned architecture
- **Identified**: Missing and outdated PlantUML diagrams
- **Provided**: AI agent guidance for priorities

### 4. Documentation Structure Analysis ✅
- **Total Files**: 141+ markdown files discovered
- **AI Context**: 20 CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md files
- **Architecture**: 44 files (1 DSL + 43 PlantUML)
- **Alignment**: 85% overall architecture alignment

## Key Findings

### CLAUDE.md Migration Status
- ✅ All CLAUDE.md files are pure pointers
- ✅ Java plugin has both files (proper migration)
- ✅ No custom guidance needing migration found

### Architecture Divergences Documented
1. **MCP Sub-Agent Support** - Not in original design (Critical)
2. **Multi-Path Index Discovery** - Single path assumption (Important)
3. **BM25 Hybrid Search** - Enhancement not planned (Positive)
4. **Index Artifact Management** - New feature (Positive)
5. **Simple Dispatcher** - Workaround for timeouts (Neutral)

### Next Steps Implementation Guide
- **Phase 1**: 50% complete (Agents 1-4 done, 5-8 pending)
- **Phase 2**: Container interfaces (waiting on Phase 1)
- **Phase 3**: Module interfaces (waiting on Phase 2)
- **Phase 4**: Internal implementation (lowest complexity)

## Validation Checks
- ✅ All CLAUDE.md files are pure pointers
- ✅ AGENTS.md contains accurate status (95% vs 100%)
- ✅ Architecture matches implementation (85% aligned)
- ✅ ROADMAP.md has actionable Next Steps with complexity
- ✅ Implementation status tracked in new file
- ✅ Cross-references maintained between files

## Recommendations for AI Agents

Based on this update, AI agents should:

1. **Continue Phase 1** - Complete agents 5-8 in parallel
2. **Start with Agent 7** - Memory management (lowest complexity: 3)
3. **Create PlantUML diagrams** - For new components (complexity: 2)
4. **Update implementation-status.md** - After each task completion
5. **Check alignment** - Before implementing new features

## Manual Review Items

The following require human architect decisions:
- Should MCP sub-agent support be added to workspace.dsl?
- Is 1GB memory limit appropriate for plugin management?
- Should multi-repository be default or opt-in feature?
