# Documentation Alignment Plan
Generated: 2025-01-06

## Governance Mode: DOCUMENT_ONLY - Existing architecture detected

## Planned Updates:

### CLAUDE.md Migrations
- All 10 CLAUDE.md files are already compliant (pure pointers)
- No custom guidance needs migration
- No action required

### Architecture Alignment
- Overall alignment: 100% (Production Ready)
- Minor gaps: 3 plugin PlantUML diagrams missing (C++, Dart, HTML/CSS)
- Action: Document these gaps, do not modify architecture

### Priority Order:
1. Update ROADMAP.md with Next Steps section (if missing)
2. Create architecture/implementation-status.md to track component status
3. Update stale AI docs (none currently stale, but check for missing)
4. Ensure all documentation is optimized for AI agents
5. Generate final validation report

## Risk Assessment:
- CLAUDE.md migrations: NO RISK (already complete)
- Architecture updates: DOCUMENTATION ONLY (no structural changes)
- AI docs updates: LOW RISK (all current, just adding missing)
- ROADMAP updates: LOW RISK (additive only)

## Rollback Strategy:
- All changes tracked in git
- No destructive changes planned
- Documentation-only updates
