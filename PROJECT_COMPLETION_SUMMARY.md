- Created comprehensive validation and testing infrastructure
- Implemented performance benchmarking suite
- Created production deployment automation

### Phase 2: Production Features (90% â†’ 95%)
- Implemented dynamic plugin loading system
- Created comprehensive monitoring framework with Prometheus and Grafana
- Added plugin management CLI tools
- Integrated metrics collection and alerting

### Phase 3: CI/CD Integration (95% â†’ 100%)
- Created complete GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Implemented automated release workflow
- Created production deployment scripts with blue-green deployment
- Added container registry management with security scanning
