# Transport Base Implementation Summary

## Completed Implementation

The base transport interface in `/workspaces/Code-Index-MCP/mcp_server/transport/base.py` has been fully implemented with the following components:

### 1. Transport State Management
- **TransportState Enum**: Comprehensive states including INITIALIZING, CONNECTING, CONNECTED, RECONNECTING, DISCONNECTING, DISCONNECTED, ERROR, and CLOSED
- Thread-safe state transitions with async locking
- State change events automatically emitted

### 2. Error Handling
- **TransportError**: Base exception class
- **ConnectionError**: For connection-related issues  
- **MessageError**: For message handling problems
- **TransportClosedError**: For operations on closed transports
- **error_handler**: Context manager for consistent error handling

### 3. Transport Metadata
- **TransportMetadata**: Tracks connection details including:
  - Transport type and ID
  - Connection timestamps (created, connected, disconnected)
  - Remote/local addresses
  - Protocol version
  - Extra custom data
  - Activity tracking

### 4. Transport Statistics
- **TransportStatistics**: Monitors transport performance:
  - Messages sent/received counts
  - Bytes sent/received
  - Error counts and details
  - Reconnection attempts

### 5. Event System
- **TransportEventType**: Enum for all transport events
- **TransportEvent**: Event data structure
- Async callback system for event handling
- Events emitted for all major operations

### 6. Core Transport Class
The abstract `Transport[T]` class provides:
- Connection lifecycle methods (connect, disconnect, close)
- Message handling (send, receive)
- State management and queries
- Reconnection support
- Comprehensive info retrieval
- Event callback registration

### 7. Buffered Transport
The `BufferedTransport[T]` class adds:
- Message buffering during disconnections
- Configurable buffer sizes
- Buffer flushing on reconnection
- Buffer statistics

## Usage Example

```python
from mcp_server.transport.base import Transport, TransportState

class WebSocketTransport(Transport[str]):
    async def connect(self, **kwargs) -> None:
        await self._set_state(TransportState.CONNECTING)
        # WebSocket connection logic
        await self._set_state(TransportState.CONNECTED)
        
    async def send(self, message: str) -> None:
        if self.is_closed:
            raise TransportClosedError("Transport is closed")
        # Send message via WebSocket
        self._statistics.record_sent(len(message))
        
    # ... implement other abstract methods
```

## Benefits for Existing Transports

Both WebSocket and stdio transports can now:
1. Inherit consistent state management
2. Use built-in error handling
3. Track statistics automatically
4. Emit standardized events
5. Provide comprehensive transport info
6. Support reconnection logic
7. Handle buffering if needed

The implementation is fully typed with generics, allowing transports to specify their message type.
