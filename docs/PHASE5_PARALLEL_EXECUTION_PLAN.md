   - Fallback: Reduce feature scope if needed

2. **Distributed System Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with simple master-worker
   - Fallback: Use existing solutions (Celery)

3. **Performance Targets**
   - Mitigation: Early benchmarking and optimization
   - Fallback: Adjust targets based on reality

### Resource Risks
1. **Developer Availability**
   - Mitigation: Cross-train developers
   - Fallback: Prioritize core languages

2. **Infrastructure Costs**
   - Mitigation: Start with minimal clusters
   - Fallback: Delay GPU acceleration

## Success Metrics

### Weekly Checkpoints

- Vector search: Embeddings generated/minute  
- Distributed: Files processed/minute
- Cache: Hit rate percentage

### Monthly Milestones
- Month 1: All foundations complete

### Final Deliverables
- [ ] 5 new language plugins (Rust, Go, Java, Kotlin, Ruby, PHP)
- [ ] 10x performance improvement for large repos
- [ ] Distributed processing supporting 10+ workers

- [ ] <100ms symbol lookup for all languages

## Next Immediate Actions

### Week 1 Sprint (All Parallel)
```bash
# Developer 1-4: Plugin Development
git checkout -b feature/phase5-language-plugins
mkdir -p mcp_server/plugins/{rust,go,jvm,ruby,php}_plugin
# Create plugin templates

# Developer 5-6: Vector Search
git checkout -b feature/phase5-vector-enhancement  
# Update semantic_indexer.py for batch processing

# Developer 7-8: Distributed Architecture
git checkout -b feature/phase5-distributed
mkdir -p mcp_server/distributed
# Create architecture design doc

# DevOps: Infrastructure
# Set up development clusters
# Configure CI/CD for parallel builds
```

### Communication Plan
- Daily standup for blockers
- Weekly cross-track sync
- Bi-weekly architecture review
- Monthly steering committee update

## Conclusion

By parallelizing development across 4 independent tracks, we can complete Phase 5 in 6-8 months with 6-8 developers. The key is maintaining independence between tracks until integration phase, allowing maximum concurrent progress.
