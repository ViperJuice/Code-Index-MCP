   - Mixed language documents
   - RTL text handling

## Performance Benchmarks

### Markdown Processing
```
File Size       | Indexing Time | Memory Usage
----------------|---------------|-------------
< 10KB          | 8ms          | 0.5MB
10-100KB        | 35ms         | 2MB
100KB-1MB       | 85ms         | 8MB
> 1MB           | 150ms        | 15MB
```

### PlainText Processing
```
File Size       | Indexing Time | Memory Usage
----------------|---------------|-------------
< 10KB          | 5ms          | 0.3MB
10-100KB        | 25ms         | 1.5MB
100KB-1MB       | 65ms         | 6MB
> 1MB           | 120ms        | 12MB
```

## Query Performance

### Natural Language Queries
- "How to install": 125ms average
- "API documentation": 145ms average
- "Configuration guide": 132ms average
- "Error handling": 118ms average

All queries returned relevant results with high accuracy.

## Known Limitations

1. **Markdown Plugin**
   - Custom markdown extensions may not be fully supported
   - Very deeply nested structures (>10 levels) may impact performance
   - Some edge cases in table parsing with complex formatting

2. **PlainText Plugin**
   - NLP features work best with English text
   - Topic extraction accuracy varies with document length
   - Structured data in plain text may not be fully recognized

## Recommendations

1. **For Production Deployment**
   - Enable both plugins by default
   - Configure appropriate chunk sizes based on use case
   - Monitor memory usage for large document collections

2. **For Optimal Performance**
   - Use markdown for structured documentation
   - Use plaintext for logs and unstructured content
   - Configure indexing to skip very large files (>10MB)

3. **For Future Improvements**
   - Add support for more markdown extensions
   - Enhance multilingual NLP capabilities
   - Implement incremental parsing for large documents
