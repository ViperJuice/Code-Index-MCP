## Usage Examples

### Quick Start
```bash
# Start full distributed system
python -m mcp_server.distributed.launcher full --workers 4

# Index a repository
python -m mcp_server.distributed.launcher index --repo-path /path/to/repo --workers 6

# Run demo
python demo_distributed.py
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Start with 8 workers
docker-compose -f docker-compose.distributed.yml up --scale worker=8

# With monitoring
docker-compose -f docker-compose.distributed.yml --profile monitoring up
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from mcp_server.distributed import IndexingCoordinator, IndexingWorker, DistributedConfig

# Setup
config = DistributedConfig(batch_size=50, max_workers=8)
coordinator = IndexingCoordinator(config)
workers = [IndexingWorker(f"worker-{i}", config) for i in range(8)]

# Process repository
jobs = coordinator.create_indexing_jobs("/path/to/repo", JobPriority.HIGH)
success = coordinator.wait_for_completion(timeout=300)
```
