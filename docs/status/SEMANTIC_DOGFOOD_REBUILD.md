- Roadmap steering: `specs/phase-plans-v7.md` now adds downstream phase
  `SEMDEVSTALE` after SEMDISKIO proved the code/test storage-closeout repair,
  but the refreshed live rerun on the new head never reached semantic
  closeout and instead re-anchored on a stale-running lexical trace at
  `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`. Older downstream assumptions should be
  treated as stale after this roadmap amendment.

## Reset Boundary

This SEMDISKIO execution stayed inside the existing repo-local dogfood
boundary:

- `.mcp-index/current.db`, `.mcp-index/semantic_qdrant/`, and
  `force_full_exit_trace.json` remained the only active runtime locations
  touched by the live rerun.
- The active semantic collection remained `code_index__oss_high__v1`.
- No destructive reset of the SQLite runtime, WAL files, or Qdrant directory
  was used before or after the rerun.

## SEMTRACEFRESHNESS Live Trace Recovery

SEMTRACEFRESHNESS repaired the stale lexical handoff at the mutation source and
operator surface:

- `mcp_server/dispatcher/dispatcher_enhanced.py` now emits a lexical progress
  snapshot as soon as a file becomes in flight instead of waiting only for the
  file to return.
- `mcp_server/storage/git_index_manager.py` already persisted dispatcher
  snapshots into `force_full_exit_trace.json`; the refreshed live rerun now
  records current `in_flight_path` values durably.
- `mcp_server/cli/repository_commands.py` now distinguishes a missing durable
  trace from a stale running trace and prints `Trace freshness:
  stale-running snapshot` when the last running snapshot ages past the
  configured lexical-timeout window.
- `tests/test_dispatcher.py` freezes the stale-trace regression shape by
  requiring a prior `last_progress_path` plus a new `in_flight_path` snapshot
  before the second lexical file returns.
- `tests/test_git_index_manager.py` freezes durable persistence of the fresh
  in-flight snapshot.
- `tests/test_repository_commands.py` freezes both the missing-trace and
  stale-running trace wording.

The earlier rerun changed shape immediately:

- At `2026-04-29T08:50:29Z`, the durable trace refreshed to
  `in_flight_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/ARCHITECTURE.md`
  with `last_progress_path=null`.
- At `2026-04-29T08:50:44Z`, the same rerun had already advanced to
  `last_progress_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/tests/test_utils.py`
  and
  `in_flight_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/tests/test_index_discovery.py`.
- The original stale shape from SEMJEDI
  (`last_progress_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/ai_docs/pytest_overview.md`
  with `in_flight_path=null`) did not recur.
- The rerun then moved to
  `last_progress_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/.devcontainer/post_create.sh`
  and
  `in_flight_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.
- The trace timestamp then stopped advancing at `2026-04-29T08:51:28Z`.
- The same frozen running snapshot was still present when observed again at
  `2026-04-29T08:52:53Z` and after the live process had been stopped by
  `2026-04-29T08:53:23Z`.

## SEMPUBLISHRACE Live Rerun Check

SEMPUBLISHRACE repaired the exact publish-race lexical seam on the prior
`HEAD`, but that earlier live rerun still re-anchored on the older
`.devcontainer` blocker family and changed the next downstream work.

Observed progression on the prior repo-local force-full command:

- At `2026-04-29T09:28:24Z`, the durable trace reset to
  `stage=force_full_started` on observed commit `aec99482`.
- At `2026-04-29T09:28:50Z`, the same rerun had already advanced to
  `last_progress_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/tests/test_semantic_preflight.py`
  and
  `in_flight_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/tests/test_dispatcher.py`.
- At `2026-04-29T09:29:02Z`, the rerun had already advanced again to
  `last_progress_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/tests/root_tests/test_contextual_pipeline.py`
  and
  `in_flight_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/tests/root_tests/test_c_plugin_simple.py`.
- At `2026-04-29T09:29:17Z`, the rerun had already advanced again to
  `last_progress_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/tests/security/fixtures/mock_plugin/plugin.py`
  and
  `in_flight_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/tests/security/fixtures/mock_plugin/__init__.py`.
- At `2026-04-29T09:29:38Z`, the rerun had already advanced again to
  `last_progress_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/ai_docs/celery_overview.md`
  and
  `in_flight_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/ai_docs/qdrant.md`.
- At `2026-04-29T09:29:40Z`, the durable trace re-anchored on
  `last_progress_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/.devcontainer/post_create.sh`
  and
  `in_flight_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.
- By `2026-04-29T09:30:32Z`, the same running snapshot was still present and
  `repository status` reported `Trace freshness: stale-running snapshot`.
- The rerun was then interrupted after evidence capture at
  `2026-04-29T09:31:19Z`.

Current seam sizing from that earlier rebound confirmed the publish-race seam
was cleared before the rerun re-anchored on the older `.devcontainer` family:

- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`: `558` bytes
- `.devcontainer/post_create.sh`: `425` bytes
- `tests/test_benchmarks.py`: `30883` bytes
- `tests/test_artifact_publish_race.py`: `16280` bytes

## SEMDEVREBOUND Live Rerun Check

SEMDEVREBOUND repaired the exact `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` lexical seam
on the prior evidence commit, but the same live rerun later re-anchored on a
later exact Python-script pair and changed the next downstream work again.

Observed progression on the earlier current repo-local force-full command:

- At `2026-04-29T09:50:53Z`, the durable trace had already advanced to
  `last_progress_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/scripts/check_index_schema.py`
  with `in_flight_path=null`.
- At `2026-04-29T09:50:55Z`, `repository status` reported the live rerun at
  `last_progress_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/scripts/rerun_failed_native_tests.py`
  and
  `in_flight_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/scripts/quick_mcp_vs_native_validation.py`.
- By `2026-04-29T09:52:03Z`, the durable trace had still not advanced beyond
  the same script pair, the earlier live process had already exited with a
  non-zero status, and `repository status` later reported `Trace freshness:
  stale-running snapshot`.

Current rebound sizing confirmed the `.devcontainer` seam was cleared before
the rerun re-anchored on the new script family:

- `scripts/check_index_schema.py`: later lexical progress observed after the
  `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` boundary was added.
- `scripts/rerun_failed_native_tests.py`: latest durable `last_progress_path`.
- `scripts/quick_mcp_vs_native_validation.py`: current exact `in_flight_path`.
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`: no longer the active blocker.

## SEMSCRIPTREBOUND Live Rerun Check

SEMSCRIPTREBOUND repaired the renewed exact
`scripts/quick_mcp_vs_native_validation.py` lexical seam on the current
`HEAD`, and the same live rerun advanced well past that script family before
failing later in semantic closeout.

Observed progression on the current repo-local force-full command:

- At `2026-04-29T10:09:17Z`, the durable trace still showed an early lexical
  snapshot on
  `last_progress_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
  with `in_flight_path=null` while the force-full command was still running.
- At `2026-04-29T10:12:58Z`, the same rerun had already advanced to
  `last_progress_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/mcp_server/plugin_system/loader.py`
  and
  `in_flight_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/mcp_server/plugin_system/interfaces.py`.
- At `2026-04-29T10:13:00Z`, `repository status` reported the live rerun at
  `last_progress_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/mcp_server/document_processing/__init__.py`
  and
  `in_flight_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/mcp_server/document_processing/chunk_optimizer.py`.
- At `2026-04-29T10:13:12Z`, the force-full command exited with
  `disk I/O error`, and the durable trace recorded
  `Trace status: completed`, `Trace stage: force_full_failed`,
  `Trace stage family: final_closeout`, and
  `Trace blocker source: final_closeout`.

Current downstream verdict confirms the renewed script rebound seam is cleared:

- `scripts/rerun_failed_native_tests.py`: no longer the latest durable
  `last_progress_path`.
- `scripts/quick_mcp_vs_native_validation.py`: no longer the active
  `in_flight_path`.
- `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`: no longer the active blocker.
- The next blocker is no longer lexical. It is the post-lexical semantic
  closeout failure `disk I/O error`.

## SEMDISKIO Live Rerun Check

SEMDISKIO repaired the code-path contract for storage-closeout classification,
runtime restoration, and operator status, but the refreshed live rerun on the
new head did not reach that intended semantic-closeout seam.

Code/test repair completed in this phase:

- `mcp_server/storage/sqlite_store.py` now records stable read-only
  provenance for `disk I/O error` and `database or disk is full`.
- `mcp_server/dispatcher/dispatcher_enhanced.py` now preserves
  `storage_closeout` semantics and storage diagnostics when the semantic
  closeout path raises a storage failure after lexical walking has completed.
- `mcp_server/storage/git_index_manager.py` now propagates the storage-closeout
  family through force-full traces and reuses the zero-summary/zero-vector
  runtime restore path for that failure family.
- `mcp_server/cli/repository_commands.py` now renders storage-closeout trace
  fields and runtime-restore context.
- `tests/test_disk_full.py`, `tests/test_dispatcher.py`,
  `tests/test_git_index_manager.py`, and `tests/test_repository_commands.py`
  freeze that repaired contract.

Observed progression on the refreshed live repo-local force-full command:

- The SEMDISKIO live rerun started on observed commit
  `c8b2d72469b9bdf7887f3f30ee411b8b529c040b`.
- By `2026-04-29T10:34:59Z`, `repository status` still showed active lexical
  progress with
  `last_progress_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/ai_docs/fastapi_overview.md`
  and
  `in_flight_path=/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/ai_docs/plantuml_reference.md`.
- The durable trace then stopped advancing at `2026-04-29T10:35:02Z` with
  `Trace stage: lexical_walking`,
  `Trace stage family: lexical`,
  `Trace blocker source: lexical_mutation`, and
  `Last progress path: /home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.
- At `2026-04-29T10:37:14Z`, the trace was still frozen on the same
  `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` marker and `repository status` reported
  `Trace freshness: stale-running snapshot`.
- The hung sync was terminated after evidence capture so the stale-running
  lexical rebound could be treated as the next roadmap slice.

Steering outcome from that live rerun:

- The SEMDISKIO code/test contract landed, but the live rerun did not
  validate the intended storage-closeout seam on the current head.
- The roadmap now adds `SEMDEVSTALE` as the nearest downstream phase.
- Older downstream assumptions should be treated as stale, including any plan
  or handoff that still treats the active blocker as the semantic-closeout
  `disk I/O error` seam on the current head.

## Rebuild Command

```bash
env OPENAI_API_KEY=dummy-local-key MCP_INDEX_LEXICAL_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=5 uv run mcp-index repository sync --force-full
```

## Rebuild Evidence

Observed runtime state during the current SEMDISKIO rerun check:

- Files indexed in SQLite: `1393`
- Code chunks indexed in SQLite: `28013`
- Summary-backed chunks: `0`
- Chunks missing summaries: `28013`
- Vector-linked chunks: `0`
- Chunks missing vectors: `28013`

Durable stage trace from `.mcp-index/force_full_exit_trace.json` after the
stale-running SEMDISKIO rerun evidence capture:

- Trace status: `running`
- Trace stage: `lexical_walking`
- Trace stage family: `lexical`
- Trace timestamp: `2026-04-29T10:35:02Z`
- Trace freshness: `stale-running snapshot`
- Trace blocker source: `lexical_mutation`
- Trace current commit: `c8b2d72469b9bdf7887f3f30ee411b8b529c040b`
- Trace indexed commit before:
  `e2e9519858c3683c06b152c94a99e52098beaec6`
- Last progress path:
  `/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
- In-flight path: `null`

Runtime containment verdict for the refreshed live rerun:

- The repaired storage-closeout/runtime-restore contract is frozen in unit
  coverage, but the live rerun never reached that seam on the current head.
- The exact bounded JSON seam for `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` has
  re-anchored as the current stale-running lexical blocker.
- The exact bounded Python seams for
  `tests/test_artifact_publish_race.py`,
  `scripts/create_multi_repo_visual_report.py`, and
  `scripts/quick_mcp_vs_native_validation.py` remain preserved as earlier
  historical boundaries rather than the current live blocker.
- The partial runtime still ends with no `chunk_summaries` and no
  `semantic_points`.

## Repository Status

`env OPENAI_API_KEY=dummy-local-key uv run mcp-index repository status`
after terminating the stale-running SEMDISKIO rerun reported:

- Lexical readiness: `stale_commit`
- Semantic readiness: `summaries_missing`
- Active-profile preflight: `ready`
- Can write semantic vectors: `yes`
- Active profile: `oss_high`
- Active collection: `code_index__oss_high__v1`
- Collection bootstrap state: `reused`
- Query surface: `index_unavailable`
- Rollout status: `partial_index_failure`
- Last sync error: `disk I/O error`
- Lexical boundary:
  `ignoring generated fast-test reports matching fast_test_results/fast_report_*.md`

- Trace stage family: `lexical`
- Trace freshness: `stale-running snapshot`
- Trace blocker source: `lexical_mutation`
- Last progress path:
  `/home/viperjuice/code/Code-Index-MCP/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`

Repository/index freshness evidence:

- Current commit: `c8b2d724`
- Indexed commit: `e2e95198`

## Query Comparison

Fixed dogfood prompt: `how does semantic setup validate qdrant and embedding readiness`

- Repo-local semantic dogfood is still blocked before semantic query routing
  because the repository query surface remains `index_unavailable`.
- Ready-path semantic metadata still remains the target once summaries and
  vectors exist: `semantic_source: "semantic"` and
  `semantic_collection_name: "code_index__oss_high__v1"`.
- `symbol` and lexical probes still point operators at
  `mcp_server/dispatcher/dispatcher_enhanced.py`,
  `mcp_server/cli/repository_commands.py`, and the renewed stale-running
  `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` lexical blocker.
- The remaining downstream work is no longer centered on the intended
  SEMDISKIO semantic-closeout `disk I/O error` seam for the current head. It
  is now centered on the renewed `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`
  stale-running lexical trace.

## Dogfood Verdict

The exact verdict string for contract checks is `local multi-repo dogfooding`.

Local multi-repo dogfooding is **still not ready** after SEMDISKIO.

Why:

- The SEMDISKIO code/test repair is real: storage-closeout classification,
  runtime restoration, and operator trace rendering are now covered in unit
  tests.
- The stale trace bug from SEMJEDI remains closed as a unit/status contract:
  the operator surface now distinguishes missing traces, stale-running traces,
  and storage-closeout traces.
- The refreshed live rerun on commit `c8b2d724` did not reach semantic
  closeout and therefore did not validate the repaired disk-I/O contract on
  the current head.
- The refreshed live rerun instead re-anchored on
  `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` and stayed in `lexical_walking` until the
  trace became stale again.
- The partial runtime still ends with `chunk_summaries = 0` and
  `semantic_points = 0`.

Steering outcome:

- SEMTRACEFRESHNESS acceptance remains satisfied for the operator surface: the
  stale-running condition is now reported truthfully instead of silently
  disappearing behind a missing trace.
- SEMSCRIPTREBOUND remains historically valid on the prior head: the earlier
  rerun did clear `scripts/quick_mcp_vs_native_validation.py` and expose the
  later disk-I/O closeout seam.
- SEMDISKIO is not complete on the current head because the live rerun never
  exercised the intended storage-closeout seam after the code/test repair.
- The roadmap now adds `SEMDEVSTALE` as the nearest downstream phase.
- Older downstream assumptions should be treated as stale, including any
  downstream phase plan or handoff that still treats the active current-head
  blocker as the semantic-closeout `disk I/O error` seam.
