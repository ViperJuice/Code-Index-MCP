# Public Package Identity

Check date: 2026-07-06 UTC

## Scope

This note freezes the repo-owned public identity contract for PUBNAME.
It is metadata-only evidence for the prepared `1.3.0` surface. It does not
claim a new package or container publication.

## Metadata Probes

PyPI JSON probe used on 2026-07-06 UTC:

```bash
python - <<'PY'
import json, urllib.request
for name in ("index-it-mcp", "code-index-mcp"):
    url = f"https://pypi.org/pypi/{name}/json"
    with urllib.request.urlopen(url, timeout=20) as response:
        payload = json.load(response)
    info = payload["info"]
    print(json.dumps({
        "name": name,
        "url": url,
        "normalized_name": info.get("name"),
        "version": info.get("version"),
        "project_urls": info.get("project_urls"),
    }, sort_keys=True))
PY
```

Observed source URLs:

- `https://pypi.org/pypi/index-it-mcp/json`
- `https://pypi.org/project/index-it-mcp/`
- `https://pypi.org/pypi/code-index-mcp/json`
- `https://pypi.org/project/code-index-mcp/`

Observed live facts:

| Package | Normalized name | Latest visible version on 2026-07-06 | Project/source URLs | Decision input |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `index-it-mcp` | `index-it-mcp` | `2.14.9` | `Homepage`, `Repository`, and `Documentation` point to `https://github.com/ViperJuice/Code-Index-MCP` | The canonical distribution name matches this repo, but live PyPI parity for the repo-owned `1.3.0` surface is not proven. |
| `code-index-mcp` | `code-index-mcp` | `2.17.0` | `Homepage` points to `https://github.com/johnhuang316/code-index-mcp` | Treat as an external or colliding package name, not this repo's install target. |

## Proof Status

- Owner/source URL proof for `index-it-mcp`: partial. The live project URLs
  point at this repository and the author metadata is `Jenner Torrence`, but
  the latest visible live version is `2.14.9` rather than this repo's prepared
  `1.3.0` surface.
- Version parity proof for `index-it-mcp`: not proven. PUBNAME therefore keeps
  public install docs on source and local-wheel proof.
- Owner/source proof for `code-index-mcp`: negative for this repo. The live
  homepage points to a different repository, so PUBNAME treats the name as
  external and avoids it in user-facing install instructions.

## Local Wheel Smoke

Repo-owned smoke command:

```bash
uv run --extra dev python scripts/release_smoke.py --wheel --stdio
```

Expected canonical entrypoints from the locally built wheel:

- `mcp-index`
- `index-it-mcp`

Removed legacy alias:

- `code-index-mcp`

## Identity Inventory

| Surface | Current surface | Decision | Rationale |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Python distribution name | `index-it-mcp` | keep | Canonical install identity for this repo. |
| Canonical CLI entrypoints | `mcp-index`, `index-it-mcp` | keep | These are the wheel entrypoints PUBNAME verifies locally. |
| Legacy console-script alias | `code-index-mcp` | drop | It collides with an external package name and is not needed as the canonical install surface. |
| Click program name | `code-index-mcp` in `mcp_server/cli/__init__.py` | defer | Runtime label is outside PUBNAME ownership and needs a later runtime-facing phase if it should change. |
| MCP client server IDs / labels | `code-index`, `code-index-mcp`, `code-index-native`, similar example IDs | keep | These are client-local labels, not Python package names. |
| Container image name | `ghcr.io/viperjuice/code-index-mcp` | keep | Container naming remains a separate public surface from the Python distribution name. |
| Profile/config filename | `code-index-mcp.profiles.yaml` | keep | Repo-shipped configuration filename, not an install target. |
| `.mcp.json` example labels | `code-index-mcp` and related server keys | keep | Example keys identify local client config entries only. |
| Repository name | `Code-Index-MCP` | keep | Repo rename is outside PUBNAME scope. |
| npm helper kit | `mcp-index-kit` | keep | Separate helper-kit identity; does not conflict with the Python distribution decision. |

## Public Docs Posture

Until a later release-evidence phase re-proves live parity for the prepared
`1.3.0` surface, public docs should:

- use `index-it-mcp` as the canonical Python distribution name;
- avoid `pip install code-index-mcp` or any other `code-index-mcp` package
  install guidance;
- prefer `uv sync --locked` or a locally built wheel for repo-owned proof; and
- classify `code-index-mcp` mentions as container/image naming, profile/config
  filenames, MCP client labels, or an explicit collision warning.
