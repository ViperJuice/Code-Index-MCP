# Phase 1 Completion Summary

## Tasks Completed

### 1. File Watcher Integration ✅
- File watcher was already connected to indexing trigger via `trigger_reindex` method
- Dispatcher has `index_file` method with caching to avoid re-indexing unchanged files
- Handles file creation, modification, and move events
- Filters for supported code file extensions

### 2. Dispatcher Auto-Initialization ✅
- Gateway now initializes dispatcher on startup automatically
- No manual initialization required
- Plugins are registered during startup event

### 3. SQLite Persistence Layer ✅
- Complete SQLite store implementation already existed in `storage/sqlite_store.py`
- Includes FTS5 for full-text search
- Trigram-based fuzzy search support
- Full schema with repositories, files, symbols, references, imports
- Integration with FuzzyIndexer for persistent storage

### 4. Missing API Endpoints ✅
All endpoints were already implemented:
- `/status` - Server status with plugin and database statistics
- `/plugins` - List of loaded plugins
- `/reindex` - Manual reindexing trigger

### 5. Error Handling and Logging ✅
- Comprehensive logging framework in `core/logging.py`
- Custom exception classes in `core/errors.py`
- Added logging throughout gateway endpoints
- Error handling with proper HTTP exceptions
- Logs to both console and file (`mcp_server.log`)

## Key Integrations Made

1. **SQLite + Plugins**: Modified Python plugin to accept SQLite store and persist symbols
2. **SQLite + FuzzyIndexer**: FuzzyIndexer now uses SQLite backend when available
3. **File Watcher + Dispatcher**: File watcher triggers dispatcher's `index_file` method
4. **Logging + Gateway**: All endpoints now have proper logging and error handling

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

Based on the roadmap, the next priorities are:

1. **Complete Stub Language Plugins** (Critical)
   - C plugin - implement Tree-sitter parsing
   - C++ plugin - implement Tree-sitter parsing  
   - JavaScript plugin - implement Tree-sitter parsing
   - Dart plugin - implement Tree-sitter parsing
   - HTML/CSS plugin - implement Tree-sitter parsing

2. **Plugin System Enhancement**
   - Dynamic plugin loading
   - Plugin configuration system
   - Plugin lifecycle management

3. **Testing Framework**
   - Set up pytest infrastructure
   - Add unit tests for all components
   - Create integration test suite

## Testing

A test script `test_persistence.py` was created to verify SQLite persistence is working correctly.

To test the complete system:
1. Start the server: `uvicorn mcp_server.gateway:app --reload`
2. Check logs in `mcp_server.log`
3. Run `python3 test_persistence.py` to verify database
4. Test endpoints:
   - `curl http://localhost:8000/status`
   - `curl http://localhost:8000/plugins`
   - `curl http://localhost:8000/search?q=test`
