# Architecture Fixes Summary

## Issues Found and Resolved

### Level 3 Component Organization Issues

1. **Duplicate Component Definitions**
   - Components were defined both inside containers and at the system level
   - Removed duplicates: treesitter_wrapper, fuzzy_indexer, semantic_indexer, graph components, operational components

2. **Missing Containers from Level 2**
   - Added missing containers:
     - Local Index Store (with storage_engine and fts_engine components)
     - Cloud Sync (with sync_engine and conflict_resolver components)
     - Embedding Service (with embedding_generator and vector_store components)
     - Security Manager (with access_controller and policy_engine components)
     - Task Queue (with queue_manager and worker_pool components)
     - Plugin Registry (with registry_store component)

3. **Language Plugin Organization**
   - Converted language plugins from components to containers
   - Each plugin now has its own container with an analyzer component inside
   - This better reflects the plugin isolation architecture

## Architecture Hierarchy Verification

### Level 1 (Context)
- Correctly shows MCP Server as the core system
- External systems: Claude, Language Plugins, Cloud, Monitoring, IDE
- Properly abstracts all internal complexity

### Level 2 (Containers)
- 15 containers total
- All containers properly represent major architectural boundaries
- Clear separation of concerns

### Level 3 (Components)
- All Level 2 containers now have components defined
- 21 containers total (15 from Level 2 + 6 language plugin containers)
- Each component has interface annotations pointing to Level 4 PlantUML files
- Component relationships properly updated

## Key Architectural Principles Maintained

1. **Interface-Bounded Architecture**
   - All components define their public interfaces
   - Components interact only through defined interfaces
   - Level 4 PlantUML files detail these interfaces

2. **Plugin Isolation**
   - Language plugins are separate containers
   - Plugin system manages lifecycle through defined interfaces
   - Clear boundaries between core and plugins

3. **Dual Storage Strategy**
   - SQLite/FTS5 for text search (Local Index Store)
   - Memgraph for graph relationships (Graph Store)
   - Clear separation of concerns

4. **Local-First Design**
   - Cloud sync is optional
   - Core functionality works offline
   - Security by isolation

## Recommendations

1. When adding new components, always:
   - Place them within appropriate containers
   - Define interface properties
   - Create corresponding Level 4 PlantUML file
   - Update relationships

2. Maintain consistency across levels:
   - Level 1: System boundaries
   - Level 2: Container boundaries
   - Level 3: Component boundaries
   - Level 4: Code-level design

3. Use the architecture as living documentation:
   - Update when adding features
   - Review during design decisions
   - Validate implementations against interfaces
