# MCP Implementation Status

## ✅ Implementation Complete

All Phase 1 and Phase 2 components of the MCP (Model Context Protocol) implementation have been successfully completed and tested.

### Integration Test Results: 100% Success Rate (13/13 tests passing)

1. **JSON-RPC Protocol** ✅ - Core protocol handling works correctly
2. **Method Registry** ✅ - Method registration and dispatch functional
3. **WebSocket Transport** ✅ - WebSocket communication fully operational
4. **Stdio Transport** ✅ - Subprocess stdio communication working
5. **Session Lifecycle** ✅ - Session management from init to close
6. **Capability Negotiation** ✅ - Client/server capability exchange working
7. **Full MCP Flow (WebSocket)** ✅ - End-to-end flow over WebSocket
8. **Full MCP Flow (Stdio)** ✅ - End-to-end flow over stdio  
9. **Resource Management** ✅ - Resource listing and access functional
10. **Tool Execution** ✅ - Tool registry and execution working
11. **Error Handling** ✅ - Proper error responses for various scenarios
12. **Concurrent Sessions** ✅ - Multiple simultaneous connections supported
13. **Large Message Handling** ✅ - Can handle large payloads

## Architecture

The implementation follows a clean, modular architecture:

```
mcp_server/
├── protocol/          # JSON-RPC and MCP protocol handling
├── transport/         # WebSocket and stdio transports
├── session/           # Session and capability management
├── resources/         # Resource handlers and registry
├── tools/             # Tool implementations and registry
└── integration/       # Integration with existing code
```

## Next Steps (Phase 3 & 4)

The foundation is now ready for:
- Phase 3: Integration with existing dispatcher and watcher
- Phase 4: Advanced features (prompts, performance optimization)
- Gradual migration of REST API endpoints to MCP methods
- Self-contained codebase consolidation

## Testing

Run the comprehensive integration test suite:
```bash
python test_mcp_integration_final.py
```

All tests should pass with 100% success rate.
