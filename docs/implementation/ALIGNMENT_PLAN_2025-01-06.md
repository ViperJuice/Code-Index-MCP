# Documentation Alignment Plan
Generated: 2025-01-06

## Governance Mode: DOCUMENT_ONLY
Existing architecture detected - will not modify structure, only annotate.

## Current Status Assessment
Based on previous analysis:
- All CLAUDE.md files are already compliant (migration completed)
- Path management implementation is complete
- System is 100% production-ready
- No critical fixes needed

## Planned Updates:

### CLAUDE.md Migrations
STATUS: âœ… Already Complete
- All 10 CLAUDE.md files are pure pointers
- No further migrations needed
- Will verify compliance only

### Architecture Alignment
STATUS: Production Ready
- No divergences detected
- All components have L4 diagrams
- Will create implementation-status.md for tracking

### Priority Order:
1. ~~Migrate custom guidance~~ - Already complete
2. Update ROADMAP.md Next Steps - Add maintenance-focused guidance
3. Create architecture/implementation-status.md - Document current state
4. Check AI docs freshness - All appear current
5. Consolidate documentation - Ensure consistency

## Risk Assessment:
- CLAUDE.md migrations: NO RISK (already done)
- Architecture updates: DOCUMENTATION ONLY (low risk)
- AI docs updates: LOW RISK (all current)
- Overall risk: MINIMAL

## Rollback Strategy:
- All changes are documentation only
- Git tracking provides natural rollback
- No code or architecture changes planned

## Execution Notes:
Since the system is already 100% complete and production-ready, this update will focus on:
1. Documenting the completed state
2. Providing maintenance guidance
3. Ensuring all documentation reflects current reality
4. Creating helpful tracking files for future maintenance
