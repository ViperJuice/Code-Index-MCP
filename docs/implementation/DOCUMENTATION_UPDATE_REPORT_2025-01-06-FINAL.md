- ✅ Architecture documents MCP issues (17% success rate)
- ✅ ROADMAP.md reflects MCP failures
- ✅ AI docs are current (<30 days old)
- ✅ Cross-platform consistency maintained

## Key Findings

1. **System Status**: 95% complete with CRITICAL MCP blocker
2. **MCP Failure Rate**: 83% in sub-agents (production blocker)
3. **Documentation Updated**: All files now reflect MCP issues
4. **Critical Work Required**: Fix MCP before production use

## Files Created/Updated

### Created
1. `ALIGNMENT_PLAN_2025-01-06.md` - Documentation update plan
2. `architecture/implementation-status.md` - Component implementation tracking
3. `DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_REPORT_2025-01-06.md` - Initial findings
4. `DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_REPORT_2025-01-06-FINAL.md` - This report

### Updated (This Session)
1. `architecture/implementation-status.md` - Added critical MCP issues section
2. `AGENTS.md` - Added MCP warning and updated priorities
3. `ROADMAP.md` - Already had MCP issues documented
4. This report - Updated to reflect MCP issues

## Next AI Agent Actions

Based on this update, AI agents should:
1. **CRITICAL**: Fix MCP sub-agent tool inheritance (83% failure)
2. **CRITICAL**: Implement multi-path index discovery
3. **HIGH**: Add pre-flight MCP validation
4. **HIGH**: Create index management CLI
5. **THEN**: Resume maintenance tasks

## System Health Summary

### Architecture
- ✅ All planned components implemented
- ✅ Full alignment between design and code
- ✅ Comprehensive L4 diagrams (30 PlantUML files)

### Features
- ✅ 48 language support via tree-sitter
- ✅ Semantic search with Voyage AI
- ✅ BM25 hybrid search
- ✅ Contextual embeddings
- ✅ Path portability
- ✅ Real-time indexing

### Operations
- ✅ CI/CD pipeline complete
- ✅ Monitoring implemented
- ✅ Security hardened
- ✅ Documentation comprehensive

## Critical Issues Summary

### MCP Sub-Agent Tool Inheritance
- **Test Results**: 83% failure rate (35/42 tests failed)
- **Root Cause**: Task agents don't inherit MCP configuration
- **Impact**: MCP unusable in production
- **Documentation**: Added to all key files

### Performance Comparison
| Metric | Native Tools | MCP |
|--------|-------------|-----|
| Success Rate | 90% | 17% |
| Average Time | 1,053ms | 983ms |
| Token Usage | 2,544 | 2,786 |

## Conclusion

The Code-Index-MCP system is 95% feature-complete but has a CRITICAL blocker preventing production use. MCP tools fail 83% of the time in sub-agents, making the system effectively unusable for its intended purpose. 

All documentation has been updated to reflect these critical issues. Native tools are recommended for production use until MCP sub-agent inheritance is fixed.

**The system is NOT ready for production deployment until MCP issues are resolved.**
