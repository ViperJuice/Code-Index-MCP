# Documentation Update Summary
# Generated: 2025-01-29

## CODEBASE_ANALYSIS_COMPLETED
- Documentation files processed: 55 markdown files
- Agent configuration files updated: 3 files (root CLAUDE.md, mcp_server/AGENTS.md, architecture/CLAUDE.md)
- IDE configuration files synchronized: None found (.cursor/, .vscode/, .anthropic/)
- Architecture files analyzed: 14 PlantUML files, 4 Structurizr DSL files

## CLEANUP_ACTIONS_EXECUTED

### Files Deleted (7 files)
- `/mcp_server/CLAUDE.md` - Contained incorrect API endpoints (/index instead of /symbol)
- `/mcp_server/plugins/c_plugin/CLAUDE.md` - Described unimplemented features
- `/mcp_server/plugins/cpp_plugin/CLAUDE.md` - Described unimplemented features
- `/mcp_server/plugins/js_plugin/CLAUDE.md` - Described unimplemented features
- `/mcp_server/plugins/dart_plugin/CLAUDE.md` - Described unimplemented features
- `/mcp_server/plugins/html_css_plugin/CLAUDE.md` - Described unimplemented features
- `/mcp_server/plugins/python_plugin/CLAUDE.md` - Redundant with AGENTS.md

### Files Merged (2 consolidations)
- `/mcp_server/plugins/CLAUDE.md` → `/CLAUDE.md` (plugin overview merged into main doc)
- `/mcp_server/plugins/AGENTS.md` → `/mcp_server/AGENTS.md` (minimal content consolidated)

### Broken Links Fixed
- No broken internal links detected after cleanup

## ARCHITECTURE_ALIGNMENT_RESULTS

### Architecture Files Found
- **PlantUML Files**: 14 files in `/architecture/level4/`
  - Includes both target design (e.g., `api_gateway.puml`) and actual implementation (e.g., `api_gateway_actual.puml`)
- **Structurizr DSL Files**: 4 files
  - `level1_context.dsl`, `level2_containers.dsl`
  - `level3_mcp_components.dsl` (target), `level3_mcp_components_actual.dsl` (current)

### Documentation Gaps Identified
- Plugin development tutorial missing
- Dispatcher initialization guide added to CLAUDE.md
- Performance benchmarks documentation missing
- Migration guide from stubs to implementations missing

### Technology Misalignments Corrected
- Clarified Tree-sitter usage in Python plugin (not AST module as originally stated)
- Noted gRPC planned for plugins but using direct imports
- Documented missing implementations: Memgraph, SQLite/FTS5, Redis
- Updated file watcher status (exists but doesn't trigger indexing)

### Agent Configs Updated with Architecture Context
- `/CLAUDE.md`: Added dispatcher initialization code example
- `/architecture/CLAUDE.md`: Added implementation status and dual architecture pattern explanation
- `/mcp_server/AGENTS.md`: Added plugin implementation status details

## VALIDATION_RESULTS
- **Link Integrity Status**: All internal documentation links valid
- **Configuration Consistency**: Agent configurations aligned across all CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md files
- **Content Preservation**: All essential technical information preserved during merges
- **Structure Compliance**: Documentation organization maintained, following existing patterns

## KEY FINDINGS
1. **Implementation Gap**: Only ~20% of planned architecture is implemented
2. **Plugin Status**: Only Python plugin has working implementation; 5 others are stubs
3. **Missing Components**: No persistence (SQLite), no graph store (Memgraph), no caching (Redis)
4. **Documentation Pattern**: Project uses dual architecture files showing both target and actual state
5. **Agent Context Files**: Clear separation between AI agent context (CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md) and human documentation

## NEW FILES CREATED
- `/workspaces/Code-Index-MCP/markdown-table-of-contents.md` - Comprehensive markdown file index
- `/workspaces/Code-Index-MCP/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_ALIGNMENT_REPORT.md` - Architecture analysis report

## RECOMMENDATIONS
1. Consider removing stub plugin AGENTS.md files after confirming no unique information
2. Implement dispatcher auto-initialization to avoid 503 errors
3. Update Python plugin documentation to reflect Tree-sitter usage consistently
4. Create plugin development guide leveraging Python plugin as reference
5. Consider consolidating dual architecture files once implementation catches up to design
