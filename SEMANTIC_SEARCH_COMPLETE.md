# Semantic Search Implementation Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented semantic search functionality for all 6 language plugins in the MCP server:

### ✅ Completed Tasks

1. **Python Plugin** - Fully functional with semantic search
   - Uses AST parsing for accurate symbol extraction
   - Supports functions, classes, and methods
   - Integrates with Voyage AI for embeddings

2. **JavaScript Plugin** - Semantic search enabled
   - Simplified implementation without tree-sitter
   - Supports functions, classes, and arrow functions
   - Works with .js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx files

3. **C Plugin** - Semantic capabilities added
   - Extracts functions, structs, and typedefs
   - Basic symbol detection using pattern matching

4. **C++ Plugin** - Semantic search working
   - Supports classes, templates, and methods
   - Handles C++ specific constructs

5. **Dart Plugin** - Semantic features implemented
   - Detects classes, functions, and async methods
   - Supports Dart-specific syntax

6. **HTML/CSS Plugin** - Semantic search enabled
   - Extracts HTML IDs and classes
   - Identifies CSS selectors
   - Works with multiple file types (.html, .css, .scss, etc.)

### Technical Implementation

- **Base Class**: `PluginWithSemanticSearch` provides semantic capabilities
- **Embeddings**: Voyage AI's `voyage-code-3` model for code embeddings
- **Vector Storage**: Qdrant (supports both HTTP and in-memory modes)
- **Integration**: Seamless fallback to traditional search when semantic is disabled

### Configuration

To enable semantic search:

1. Set environment variables:
   ```bash
   SEMANTIC_SEARCH_ENABLED=true
   VOYAGE_API_KEY=your-api-key
   QDRANT_HOST=localhost:6333  # or :memory: for in-memory mode
   ```

2. Each plugin automatically uses its semantic version when enabled

3. Search with semantic flag:
   ```python
   results = plugin.search("find async data fetching functions", {"semantic": True})
   ```

### Architecture

```
Plugin → PluginWithSemanticSearch → SemanticIndexer → Voyage AI
                                                    ↓
                                                 Qdrant DB
```

All plugins now inherit from `PluginWithSemanticSearch` when semantic search is enabled, providing:
- Automatic embedding generation during indexing
- Semantic search capabilities
- Fallback to traditional fuzzy search
- Unified interface across all languages

### Testing

All plugins tested and verified with realistic code examples:
- Python: Prime checking and factorial functions
- JavaScript: Async API calls and data processing
- C: Linked list implementation
- C++: Template containers and classes
- Dart: Async services and data models
- HTML/CSS: Web page structure and styling

## Next Steps

The semantic search implementation is complete and ready for production use. Consider:
- Performance optimization for large codebases
- Caching frequently accessed embeddings
- Fine-tuning similarity thresholds
- Adding more sophisticated symbol extraction
