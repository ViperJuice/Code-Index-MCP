# Repository Indexing Status

## Summary

We've successfully cleaned up duplicate scripts and created comprehensive indexing capabilities. However, indexing entire repositories with semantic embeddings is extremely time and resource intensive.

## Current Status

### Successfully Indexed (Full Repository)
- **phoenix (C)**: 30 files → 302 embeddings (21s)
- **redis (C)**: 766 files → 6,111 embeddings (415s / 7 minutes)

### Partial/In Progress
- **grpc (C++)**: 6,189 files → 28,798 chunks (timed out during embedding creation)

### Challenges
1. **Scale**: Some repositories are massive (grpc has 6,189 code files)
2. **Time**: Full indexing of all repos would take many hours
3. **API Costs**: Voyage AI charges per token - full indexing would be expensive
4. **Storage**: Full embeddings for all repos would require significant storage

## Scripts Available

### Primary Indexing Script
- `scripts/index_repositories.py` - Unified entry point with modes:
  - `--mode full`: SQL + Semantic indexing using MCP
  - `--mode sql`: BM25/FTS indexing only (fast, free)
  - `--mode semantic`: Semantic embeddings only

### Specialized Scripts
- `scripts/index_all_repos_with_mcp.py` - Uses full MCP stack
- `scripts/index_all_repos_semantic_full.py` - Creates embeddings for ALL files
- `scripts/index_all_repos_semantic_simple.py` - Limited to 2000 lines per file
- `scripts/index_test_repos_semantic_only.py` - Limited to 50 files per repo

## Recommendations

1. **For Testing**: Use the limited scripts (50-100 files per repo)
2. **For Production**: 
   - Use SQL-only indexing for full repositories
   - Add semantic indexing selectively for important files
3. **For Cost Control**: 
   - Limit embedding creation to key files
   - Use chunking strategies to reduce token usage

## Code Cleanup Completed

### Dispatcher
- Migrated from `Dispatcher` to `EnhancedDispatcher`
- Updated all imports and test files
- Archived old implementations

### Scripts
- Consolidated 40+ duplicate scripts
- Created unified entry points
- Archived old versions in `/archive/`

### Benefits
- Cleaner codebase structure
- No more confusion about which script to use
- Consistent implementation across all components
