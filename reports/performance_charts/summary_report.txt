MCP vs Grep Pipeline Performance Report
Generated: 2025-06-14 06:23
=====================================

KEY FINDINGS:

1. TOKEN USAGE REDUCTION:
   • Symbol Search: 97.5% reduction (12,330 → 305 tokens)
   • Semantic Search: 99.7% reduction (668,071 → 2,000 tokens)
   • Refactoring: 98.5% reduction (100,020 → 1,500 tokens)
   • Pattern Search: -43% (grep wins for simple patterns)

2. THE GREP PIPELINE PROBLEM:
   Traditional grep workflow requires:
   1. Search for pattern → Find files
   2. Read ENTIRE files containing matches
   3. Send all file contents to LLM
   
   This results in massive token usage because entire files must be processed,
   not just the relevant portions.

3. COST IMPLICATIONS (Per Search):
   Example - Finding a class definition:
   • Claude 4 Opus: $0.92 (grep) vs $0.02 (MCP) = 98% savings
   • GPT-4.1: $0.10 (grep) vs $0.002 (MCP) = 98% savings
   • DeepSeek-V3: $0.01 (grep) vs $0.0003 (MCP) = 97% savings

4. MONTHLY SAVINGS (1000 searches/day):
   • Claude 4 Opus: Save $27,000/month
   • GPT-4.1: Save $2,940/month
   • GPT-4.1 nano: Save $294/month
   • DeepSeek-V3: Save $297/month

RECOMMENDATIONS:
• Use MCP for any code understanding task
• Use MCP for finding symbols, methods, classes
• Use MCP for semantic/conceptual searches
• Use MCP for refactoring and cross-file analysis
• Only use grep for simple pattern matching when you just need line numbers

CONCLUSION:
MCP's pre-built indexes eliminate the need to read entire files, resulting in
97-99% token reduction for most real-world development tasks.
