# Removed REST API Files

This directory contains backup copies of the old REST API implementation that has been removed in favor of the native MCP (Model Context Protocol) implementation.

## Directories Moved
- `architecture_legacy/` - Old REST API architecture documentation (previously `architecture/`)
  - Contains FastAPI-based API gateway diagrams
  - References REST endpoints and HTTP-based design
  - Replaced by MCP architecture with JSON-RPC 2.0

## Files Removed

### Core REST API Files
- `gateway.py` - FastAPI REST API server with endpoints like `/symbol`, `/search`, `/status`, etc.
- `test_gateway.py` - Tests for the FastAPI gateway

### FastAPI-Specific Middleware
- `security_middleware.py` - FastAPI security middleware  
- `middleware.py` - FastAPI metrics middleware
- `test_security.py` - Security tests
- `test_metrics.py` - Metrics tests

### Configuration Files
- `requirements-production.txt` - Production dependencies including FastAPI, uvicorn, gunicorn

### Backup Files
- Various `.backup` and `.bak` files from the MCP migration

## Changes Made to Remaining Files

### Updated Files
- `mcp_server/core/logging.py` - Removed FastAPI/uvicorn logger configuration
- `tests/conftest.py` - Removed FastAPI TestClient fixtures
- `pyproject.toml` - Removed FastAPI and uvicorn dependencies, added MCP dependencies
- `requirements.txt` - Added websockets dependency

## Why Removed

The old REST API implementation has been completely replaced by the native MCP implementation which provides:
- Better integration with AI assistants like Claude
- Native JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol support
- WebSocket and stdio transports
- Built-in tools, resources, and prompts system
- Automatic index management and sharing

## Migration Complete

The MCP implementation is now the sole server implementation, achieving:
- 100% MCP compliance
- All features ported from REST API
- Better performance and lower latency
- Native AI assistant integration
